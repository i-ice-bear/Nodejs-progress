Some of my complete node.js progress from starting. to upper level including http static server, express server, file generating and many more included init. 
## Appendix which help you a lot.

💨 Want to host your web application which supports any framework with quick runtime with zero delay visit - [{ Vercel }](https://vercel.com) for more information.

💨 Visit my github profile to get awesome project ideas from there - [Github - Ice Bear](https://github.com/i-ice-bear)

💨 Build your advance Search Prototype with algolia with instant runtime then visit - [Algolia](https://algolia.com) 
## 🚀 About Me
I'm a web developer and graphic designer...

I love my work and i like it as much I like mr' smoothies along with caramel smoothe and chew the straw with my mouth.
Some times i upload only half designs because, i'm dumb 😂 seriously too much dumb 😂😂😂.

Sometimes it's also being annoying for me 😑 when someone saw me to sucking straw like a baby kid... specially girls....

## Features

- Instant runtime
- Build in Node.js
- Cross platform
- Code already prepared alot.


## 🛠 Skills 
: HTML : CSS : Javascript : React.js : Next.js : Android Development :  



## 🚄 Optimizations

- Some of the Optimizations are done with the main host of the appliaction and that is the app component. 
- Reduced usage of extra CDN which makes effect on the runtime and loading time for the application.
- Instead of using cdn's I used node modules for improving the runtime and delievery of appliaction.
- All of the components are broken into many pieces like search bar having their own component in a seperate folder and images are stored in another folder and each component code contains maximum 300 lines of code. for some amount of more Optimizations.
